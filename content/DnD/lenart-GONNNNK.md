# Star-Scoundrel
Star-Scoundrel is a hack of Ben Milton's [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) RPG, in the OSR vein. The goals of this hack/expansion is to: 
*a)* Port Knave to a sci-fi setting
*b)* Expand upon the core ideas in a consistent, thematic way.

In practice, this means keeping the game __classless__ and having __attributes__ play the central role in resolving conflict. Additionally, the modular and open nature of the Knave system should be maintained, to allow further expansion.

## Attributes

The amount that an attribute is above or below 10 is considered the **attribute modifier**

## Mechanics
Most actions in P-dRPG are resolved with __d20__ rolls + an __attribute modifier__.

### Defense

### Melee Combat

### Ranged Combat
