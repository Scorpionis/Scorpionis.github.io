# Star-Scoundrel
Star-Scoundrel is a hack of Ben Milton's [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) RPG, in the OSR vein. The goals of this hack/expansion is to: 
*a)* Port Knave to a sci-fi setting
*b)* Expand upon the core ideas in a consistent, thematic way.

In practice, this means keeping the game __classless__ and having __[attributes](#ATTRIBUTES)__ play the central role in resolving conflict. Additionally, the modular and open nature of the Knave system should be maintained, to allow further expansion.

## ATTRIBUTES

The amount that an attribute is above or below 10 is considered the **attribute modifier**

## MECHANICS
Most actions in P-dRPG are resolved with __d20__ rolls + an __attribute modifier__.

### DEFENSE

### Melee Combat

### Ranged Combat

## Ships

### Ship Attributes

#### Size
Size is the base size, volume and mass of a ship. It effects the amount of hits the ship can take, and also the natural ability
- **Tiny (Crew-size 1)**: This is a single man ship used for intrastellar operations. By default, it has 20 **hit points** and 2 **module slots**. A frame of this size on average costs *400,000 credits*.
- **Small (Crew-size 1-4)**: This is a small vessel, used primarily for civilian use, and occasionally guerilla warfare. By default, it has 35 **hit points** and 3 **module slots**. A frame of this size on average costs *750,000 credits*.
- **Medium (Crew-size 3-8)**: This is a medium vessel, used by medium sized corporations or by localised defense forces. By default, it has 50 **hit points** and 4 **module slots**. A frame of this size on average costs *1,000,000 credits*.
- **Large (Crewsize 5-15)**: This is a large ship, used for transtellar corporations, national militaries and powerful mercenary groups. By default, it has 75 **hit points** and 6 **module slots**. A frame of this size on average costs  *2,000,000 credits*.

#### Agility
The natural maneuverability of the ship. This provides a bonus to the **Pilot's** roles when flying or evading other ships.
A 0 signifies a sluggish, lumbering ship while a 4 signifies a state of the art military vessel pushing the limits of current technology.
